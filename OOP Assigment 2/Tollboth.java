Task # 7
Create a class called tollbooth. The two data items are unsigned int to hold the total number of cars, and 
a type double to hold the total amount of money collected. A constructor initializes both of these to 0. A 
member function called payingCar() increments the car total and adds 0.50 to the cash total. Another 
function called noPayCar(), increments the car total but adds nothing to the cash total. Finally, a 
member function called display() displays the two totals. Make appropriate member functions.
The program should allow the user to push one key to count a paying car, and another to count a nonpaying car. Pushing the Esc key should cause the program to print out the total cars and total cash and 
then exit.
Create a class called Student. It will contain member functions that will read and print student’s detail 
using atleast 8 of the student’s attributes for example: his/her ID, First name, Last Name, Contact, City, 
DOB, Current Semester, No. of courses enrolled etc.
The program should allow the user to enter his/her details and print them accordingly
